        <h4>Keep At It!</h4>
        <p>
          It can be overwhelming to learn something completely new to you. The
          more you work with different coding scenerios, the more comfortable
          you will become.
        </p>
        <h4>Coding Involves Continuous Learning.</h4>
        <p>
          You won't feel completely comfortable with coding right away. You can
          feel like an "imposter". This is normal and should just push you to
          keep learning and becoming more comfortable with coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tech world is ever-changing and the only way to keep up is to be a
          continuous learner of code.
