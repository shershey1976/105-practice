                    <h3>Take a Pause</h3>
                    <p>No one said this was going to be easy. When it's getting frustrating & you feel like giving up, take pause. Walk around the block. Distract yourself with something and come back to the problem with a clear head.</p>

                <div class="help">
                    <h3>Don't be Afraid to Ask for Help</h3>
                    <p>Read the slack channel for informative information you may come across. Ask for help and don't feel ashamed. Everyone has gone through your frustration and is willing to help you. Reach out if all else fails.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="never">
                    <h3>Never Give Up</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes it is just not clicking, but don't give up. Take a break, ask for help, but never give up. If life wasn't challenging, no one would ever make the effort to be great. You're on the right path, you just have to trust it.</p>
