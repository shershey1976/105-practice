                <h4>Don't limit yourslef!</h4>
                <p>Let go of all of the negative ideas in your mind that tell you, "you can't do this". That is your brain protecting you from "harm". <br> You see, when you learn something new, your brain protects you from the unknown. There is surely a learning curve (as with anything in life) so don't give up thinking you can't do it, because you can! <br> The first step is to give it a try!</p>
 
 
                <h4>Give yourself some grace</h4>
                
                 <p> You are learning something new and you can't expect to know it all from the start. You also shouldn't compare to others. <br> Watch/read the lessons, practice, do your homework and eventually you'll get better. <br> Don't foget to take breaks, our brain works better when we spend time of deep learning followed by breaks so that it can "absorbe" the information and create new pathways. </p>
