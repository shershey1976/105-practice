                <h4>Don't learn in isolation!</h4>
                <p>As exciting as it is to start something new, there is only so far you can go alone.</p>

                <p>I found out quickly that utilizing Slack, amongh other things, to get input from others is key to being successful. Many challenges you encounter have been seen and solved by others before you.</p>

                <h4>Don't be an imposter!</h4>
                <p>It's normal to feel like an imposter when learning something new. Trust yourself and be confident in you ability to master a new skill.</p>

                <p>There is no "type" when it comes to learning a new skill. If you enjoy it and put in the work, you belong.</p>
